What did I do this week?
I saw YT videos on alpha-beta pruning and read the feedback from week 3. I implemented a Gomoku game with alpha-beta pruning and move pruning heuristics, and wrote tests for it.

How has the program progressed?
Itâ€™s now more efficient with smarter move generation and better AI performance. I fulfilled some of the requirements of the game such as:
- Only check empty positions within 2 cells of existing stones.
- Prioritize moves adjacent to the last move


What did I learn this week/today?
How to implement alpha-beta pruning with heuristics and how to write effective unit tests for game logic.

What remains unclear or has been challenging?
Fine-tuning the move ordering and understanding how to best evaluate game states efficiently.

What will I do next?
Improve the evaluation function and possibly add a GUI or better input system for smoother gameplay.
