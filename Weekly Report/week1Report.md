1. What did I do this week?

I was looking through the prject examples, and stubled upon GFTS, which lead me to think about what kind of app I could make. It would revolve around querying data from digitransit and diplaying it, with an emphasis on processing the data with an algorith/graph. I understood HSL opensource data a bit more and understood its accessability. 

2. How has the program progressed?

Decided on Topic, Programming Language, and Scope. I realized tat I would be using python as the main programming language as I am not too familiar with other programming languages. I might be testing the application on web using Flask. To diplay the map I will be using OpenSSL.

3. What did I learn this week/today?

I reasearched how to use HSL open data and understood that they are supported by digitransit which has API fir various HSL use cases. I learned that you can test queries online on their website.

4. What remains unclear or has been challenging?

I wonder, since the project will use an API key from Digitransit, if testing by the peer reviewers and course conductors would be fine.


(Answer this honestly, as you can receive help based on your response.)
5. What will I do next?

Start by exploring the digi transit transit API and running some queries online on their website. I would also see some YT videos on consult GPT on how todesign update the location of an object everynow and then.
