# Week 2 Report

1. What did I do this week?
This week I changed the topic of my project from the HSL route finder to a Gomoku game AI. I first updated the Specification document, and then started to make just a regular gomoku game without the AI. I used GPT for see how to implement it using the prompt: 'steps to code a gomoku game', I did not use gptto generate to use for the project but rather took inspiration from it. I learnt what pylint is and how it is used to check for errors.



2. How has the program progressed?
I made the gomoku terminal based game, so basically the underlying logic of the game. I initialized poetry for dependency management for the project. 
I install pytest for testing. I am considering a very simple min max algorithm which I found online to test out first before specifically alphabeta pruning. I installed pylint for error checking. 


3. What did I learn this week/today?
I learned that poetry is a dependency managing tool which would be useful for the peer reviewers and testing outside my local computer. I also learned 
that testing is important, so I install pytest as a poetry module, I still need to understand how to conduct good testing practices for this project because this is a totally new concept and I have never used testing before. I learned more about min max algoritms and read a little about alpha-beta pruning.



4. What remains unclear or has been challenging?
The testing part is a bit unclear. How to make tests for this algorithm is rather strange. 

(Answer this honestly, as you can receive help based on your response.)
5. What will I do next?

I will probably be learning how to use alpha beta pruning for gomoku next week, I also have an idea of making this game a simple UI, rather than be based on terminal.

How many hours did you spend this week?
Around 17h
