What did I do this week?
I took the feed back of week 4, I deleted the unused just minimax version of the game. I worked on the tests this week, looked at the material provided in thr course and worked on the Implementation Document
and the Testing Document. I took the peer review feed back and deleted the parameter board because it is unused in my gomoku.py file.

How has the program progressed?
I deleted unnessary files, cleaned it up and worked on making the algorithm more efficient and applied the feedback from Labtool and evaluate function has a functionality now.

What did I learn this week/today?
I learned more on testing the program I made and writing documentation.

What remains unclear or has been challenging?
Writing more tests and improving the algorithm to play better.

What will I do next?
Improving the documentation and perhaps the GUI after making good tests.
