# What did I do this week?
I implemented a minimax algorithm and connected it to the gomuku game which is now 20x20 instead of 5x5. I learned about alpha-beta pruning more and 
unit testing games.
# How has the program progressed?
The AI has been develeoped, I looked at a minmax implementation for gomoku 20x20 online and found some good sources.
# What did I learn this week/today?
I revised how minmax algorithms work, looked at some online sources and youtube to have a minimax gomoku playing bot.
# What remains unclear or has been challenging?
How to do a better heuristic evaluation function, because right now the AI is almost repeating itself everytime. I dont exactly know what good
unit tests would look like for this application. the Size of the board is pretty big, I am still trying to balance the evaluation of board.
 
# Answer this honestly, as you can receive help based on your response.

# What will I do next?
I will be making the AI perform better, better heuristic function, I want the AI to perform better
and I need to implement the alpha-beta pruning somehow. The UI is not that important for now. I also need to implement some unit tests.
